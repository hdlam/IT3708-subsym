\section{Implementation of the proposed system}
Modifications and translation of the provided code etc.

\subsection{System}
The system consist is a webots simulation which uses a world file provided by the course stab. The world file consists of a food-box inside a closed square arena (4 walls) with 7 e-pucks. The box is emitting light along with another global directional light.

The changes we made to the world file was dimming the directional light a bit so the e-puck bots would be more sensitive to the light emitter from the food source, and we changed the attenuation of the box. The attenuation of a point light is calculated as such: $ att = \frac{1}{x+y*r+z*r^2} $ where $r$ is the distance to the emitter. We changed the value of $x$ to 0 and $z$ to 10 - this is because according to the documentation it is recommended to change default attenuation to $[0,0,4\pi]$ which is more realistic. 
\subsection{Box pushing}
%Implement control system for the box pushing task as provided in the assignment text and
%describe the expected and unexpected behaviours observed during simulation.
The bots uses the distance sensor in the search behavior where they walk aimlessly around searching for the food source. Whenever they see the box/food in front of them they will start the retrieval behavior which uses the light sensors to locate the box (this is possible because it is emitting light).


\section{Discovered weaknesses}
 %Identify areas of the system that may be improved in the single box scenario. These areas may be in overall architecture of controller or at the individual sub-behaviour task. Provide suggestions (one or more) to address these improvements
